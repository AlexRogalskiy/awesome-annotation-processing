# Contribution Guide

Contributions to this awesome list are very welcomed!
Processor to be added should be generally useful, available on Maven Central, actively maintained and see some adoption.
Presentations and blog posts to be added should provide some special insight over the already listed ones
(i.e. it should be avoided to list many introductory level posts with basically the same contents).
